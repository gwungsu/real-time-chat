# real-time-chat
This project sets up a server using Node.js and Socket.io and allows users to send and receive messages in real-time using a simple chat interface. When a user sends a message, it is emitted to all connected sockets using io.emit(). When a message is received, it is added to the chat log using JavaScript on the client-side. Note that this example is a very basic chat application and would need to be further customized for security and scalability in a production environment but will work just fine for Javascript II course.
